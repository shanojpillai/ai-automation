# Building AI Agents with the AI Automation Platform

This guide will help you create custom AI agents using the AI Automation Platform.

## Understanding AI Agents

An AI agent is a system that can:
1. Perceive its environment
2. Make decisions based on that perception
3. Take actions to achieve specific goals

In our platform, agents are implemented as n8n workflows that combine:
- LLM capabilities (via Ollama)
- Knowledge retrieval (via Qdrant)
- Custom logic and integrations

## Agent Architecture

A typical agent in our platform consists of:

1. **Input Handler**: Receives and processes user queries or events
2. **Context Builder**: Gathers relevant information from various sources
3. **Reasoning Engine**: Uses the LLM to analyze the context and make decisions
4. **Action Executor**: Performs actions based on the LLM's output
5. **Response Generator**: Formats and returns the results

## Creating a Basic Agent

Let's create a simple agent that can answer questions and perform basic tasks:

1. Open n8n at http://localhost:5678
2. Create a new workflow
3. Add a Webhook node as the entry point
4. Add an HTTP Request node to call the Ollama API
5. Add a Function node to process the response
6. Add a Respond to Webhook node to return the result

### Example: Task Management Agent

Here's how to build a task management agent:

1. Create a new workflow in n8n
2. Add these nodes:
   - Webhook (entry point)
   - Function (to parse the user's request)
   - Switch (to determine the intent: add task, list tasks, etc.)
   - HTTP Request (to interact with a task API)
   - Function (to format the response)
   - Respond to Webhook (to return the result)

3. In the parsing function, use prompt engineering to extract the intent:
   ```javascript
   // Example function code
   const prompt = `
   Analyze the following user request and extract the intent and parameters:
   "${$json.query}"
   
   Return a JSON object with:
   - intent: "add_task", "list_tasks", "complete_task", or "unknown"
   - parameters: any relevant details like task name, due date, etc.
   `;
   
   // Call Ollama for analysis
   // Process the response
   // Return structured data
   ```

## Adding RAG Capabilities

To enhance your agent with knowledge from your documents:

1. Add an HTTP Request node to get embeddings for the user query
2. Add an HTTP Request node to search Qdrant
3. Add a Function node to extract relevant context
4. Include the context in your prompt to the LLM

## Agent Orchestration

For complex scenarios, you can create multiple specialized agents and orchestrate them:

1. Create a "router" workflow that analyzes the user request
2. Based on the intent, call different specialized agent workflows
3. Combine and format the results

## Best Practices

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Craft clear, specific prompts for your LLM
2. **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling to manage LLM failures
3. **Context Management**: Be mindful of context length limitations
4. **Testing**: Create test cases for your agents to ensure reliability
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging to track agent performance and issues

## Advanced Techniques

- **Tool Use**: Enable your agent to use external tools via API calls
- **Memory**: Implement conversation history for contextual interactions
- **Feedback Loops**: Add mechanisms for the agent to learn from user feedback
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Implement chain-of-thought prompting for complex tasks

## Example: Custom Agent JSON

Here's a simplified example of a custom agent workflow in JSON format:

```json
{
  "name": "Custom Task Agent",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "httpMethod": "POST",
        "path": "task-agent"
      },
      "name": "Webhook",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook"
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "functionCode": "// Parse user request"
      },
      "name": "Parse Intent",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.function"
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "conditions": {
          "string": [
            {
              "value1": "={{ $json.intent }}",
              "operation": "equal",
              "value2": "add_task"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "name": "Route Intent",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.switch"
    },
    // Additional nodes for each intent and action
  ],
  "connections": {
    // Node connections
  }
}
```

You can export this JSON from n8n and save it in your workflows directory for reuse.
